## Text Alphabetizer
Using this text alphabetizer is fairly straightforward:
- Download the files in the repo.
- Open a terminal with node and cd to the directory containing the files
- Ensure that story.txt file is in the directory
```bash
  ls
  # Output should look like this:
  alphabetizeText.js  helpers  story.txt
```
- Run the program and respond to the CLI prompts.
```bash
  node alphabetizeText.js
```
- you can find the generated .txt file in the new "outputs" directory.


### Notes
- Any .txt file can be moved into the parent directory and used instead of "story.txt"
- If preserving quotes, The .txt file cannot have any out of place quotation marks.
- Some minor edits to the text may be required to make it work properly.
- The "story.txt" file was modified to remove 2 floating quotation marks.
