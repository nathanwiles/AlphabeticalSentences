Using this program is fairly straightforward:
- Download the files in the repo.
- Open a terminal with node and cd to the directory containing the files
- Ensure that story.txt file is in the directory
```bash
  ls
  # Output should look like this:
  alphabetizeText.js  helpers  story.txt
```
- Run the program and respond to the CLI prompts.
```bash
  node alphabetizeText.js
```
- you can find the generated .txt file in the new "outputs" directory.
